# huggingface_downloader
Download huggingface models with/without credentitals.

Original snapshot_download function from huggingface_hub often gets trouble when downloading large files. So I write my own, also with progress bar to indicate the download progresses. 
To use, install the dependencies and run:
```bash
python download.py

```
